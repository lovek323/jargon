\mainentry{elegant} adj.

[common; from mathematical usage] Combining simplicity, power, and a certain ineffable grace of design. Higher praise than `clever',
`winning', or even \citeentry{cuspy}.

The French aviator, adventurer, and author Antoine de Saint-Exup\'{e}ry, probably best known for his classic children's book ``The Little
Prince'', was also an aircraft designer. He gave us perhaps the best definition of engineering elegance when he said ``A designer knows he
has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.''
