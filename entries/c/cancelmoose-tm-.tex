\mainentry{Cancelmoose[tm]} /kan'sel-moos/

[Usenet] The archetype and model of all good \citeentry{spam}-fighters. Once
upon a time, the 'Moose would send out spam-cancels and then post notice
anonymously to news.admin.policy, news.admin.misc, and
alt.current-events.net-abuse. The 'Moose stepped to the fore on its own
initiative, at a time (mid-1994) when spam-cancels were irregular and
disorganized, and behaved altogether admirably -- \Changes{Was a hyphen.} fair,
even-handed, and quick to respond to comments and criticism, all without
self-aggrandizement or martyrdom. Cancelmoose[tm] quickly gained near-unanimous
support from the readership of all three above-mentioned groups.

Nobody knows who Cancelmoose[tm] really is, and there aren't even any good
rumors. However, the 'Moose now has an e-mail address (\url{moose@cm.org}) and a
web site (\url{http://www.cm.org}).\Changes{The full stop was inside the
parentheses.}

By early 1995, others had stepped into the spam-cancel business, and appeared to
be comporting themselves well, after the 'Moose's manner. The 'Moose has now
gotten out of the business, and is more interested in ending spam (and cancels)
entirely.
