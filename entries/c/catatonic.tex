\mainentry{catatonic} adj.

Describes a condition of suspended animation in which something is so
\citeentry{wedged} or \citeentry{hung} that it makes no response. If you are
typing on a terminal and suddenly the computer doesn't even echo the letters
back to the screen as you type, let alone do what you're asking it to do, then
the computer is suffering from catatonia (possibly because it has crashed).
``There I was in the middle of a winning game of \citeentry{nethack} and it went
catatonic on me! Aaargh!'' Compare \citeentry{buzz}.
