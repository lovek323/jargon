\mainentry{can} vt.

To abort a job on a time-sharing system. Use esp. when the person doing the deed
is an operator, as in ``canned from the console''. Frequently used in an
imperative sense, as in ``Can that print job, the LPT just popped a sprocket!''
Synonymous with \citeentry{gun}. It is said that the ASCII character with
mnemonic CAN (0011000) was used as a kill-job character on some early OSes.
Alternatively, this term may derive from mainstream slang `canned' for being
laid off or fired.
