\mainentry{cathedral} n.,adj.

[see \citeentry{bazaar} for derivation] The `classical' mode of software
engineering long thought to be necessarily implied by \citeentry{Brooks's Law}.
Features small teams, tight project control, and long release intervals. This
term came into use after analysis of the GNU/Linux experience suggested there
might be something wrong (or at least incomplete) in the classical assumptions.
