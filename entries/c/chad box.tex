\mainentry{chad box} n.

A metal box about the size of a lunchbox (or in some models a large
wastebasket), for collecting \citesense{chad}{2} that accumulated in
\citeentry{Iron Age} card punches. You had to open the covers of the card punch
periodically and empty the chad box. The \citeentry{bit bucket} was notionally
the equivalent device in the CPU enclosure, which was typically across the room
in another great gray-and-blue box.
