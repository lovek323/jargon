\mainentry{cascade} n.

\begin{inparaenum}
\item A huge volume of spurious error-message output produced by a compiler with
    poor error recovery. Too frequently, one trivial syntax error (such as a
    missing `)' or `\}') throws the parser out of synch so that much of the
    remaining program text is interpreted as ill-formed.
\item A chain of Usenet followups, each adding some trivial variation or riposte
    to the text of the previous one, all of which is reproduced in the new
    message; an \citeentry{include war} in which the object is to create a sort
    of communal graffito.
