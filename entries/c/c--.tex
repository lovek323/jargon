\mainentry{C++} /C'-pluhs-pluhs/ n.

Designed by Bjarne Stroustrup of AT\&T Bell Labs as a successor to
\citeentry{C}. Now one of the \citeentry{languages of choice}, although many
hackers still grumble that it is the successor to either Algol 68 or
\citeentry{Ada} (depending on generation), and a prime example of
\citeentry{second-system effect}. Almost anything that can be done in any
language can be done in C++, but it requires a \citeentry{language lawyer} to
know what is and what is not legal --\opt{changes}{\footnote{There was no space
before the en dash.}} the design is almost too large to hold in even hackers'
heads. Much of the \citeentry{cruft} results from C++'s attempt to be backward
compatible with C. Stroustrup himself said in his retrospective book ``The
Design and Evolution of C++'' (p. 207), ``Within C++, there is a much smaller
and cleaner language struggling to get out.'' [Many hackers would now add ``Yes,
and it's called \citeentry{Java}''.\opt{changes}{\footnote{There was no full
stop.}} -- ESR]
