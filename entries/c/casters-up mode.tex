\mainentry{casters-up mode} n.

[IBM, prob. fr. slang belly up] Yet another synonym for `broken' or `down'.
Usually connotes a major feature. A system (hardware or software) which is
`down' may be already being restarted before the failure is noticed, whereas one
which is `casters up' is usually a good excuse to take the rest of the day off
(as long as you're not responsible for fixing it).
