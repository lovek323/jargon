\mainentry{cd tilde} /C-D til-d*/ vi.

To go home. From the Unix C-shell and Korn-shell command ~, which takes one to
one's \$HOME (cd with no arguments happens to do the same thing). By extension,
may be used with other arguments; thus, over an electronic chat link, cd ~coffee
would mean ``I'm going to the coffee machine.''
