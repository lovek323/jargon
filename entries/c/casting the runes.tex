\mainentry{casting the runes} n.

What a \citeentry{guru} does when you ask him or her to run a particular program
and type at it because it never works for anyone else; esp. used when nobody can
ever see what the guru is doing different from what J. Random Luser does.
Compare \citeentry{incantation}, \citeentry{runes}, \citeentry{examining the
entrails}; also see the AI koan about Tom Knight in \citeappendix{Some AI
Koans}\Changes{Was ``Some AI Koans'', but the quotation marks make no sense
here.}.

A correspondent from England tells us that one of ICL's most talented systems
designers used to be called out occasionally to service machines which the
\citeentry{field circus} had given up on. Since he knew the design inside out,
he could often find faults simply by listening to a quick outline of the
symptoms. He used to play on this by going to some site where the field circus
had just spent the last two weeks solid trying to find a fault, and spreading a
diagram of the system out on a table top. He'd then shake some chicken bones and
cast them over the diagram, peer at the bones intently for a minute, and then
tell them that a certain module needed replacing. The system would start working
again immediately upon the replacement.
