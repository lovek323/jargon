\mainentry{AIDX} /ayd'k*z/ n.

Derogatory term for IBM's perverted version of Unix, AIX, especially for the AIX 3.? used in the IBM R5/6000 series (some hackers think it
is funnier just to pronounce ``AIX'' as ``aches')). A victim of the dreaded ``hybridism'' disease, this attempt to combine the two main
currents of the Unix stream (\citeentry{BSD} and \citeentry{USG Unix}) became a \citeentry{monstrosity} to haunt system administrators'
dreams. For example, if new accounts are created while many users are logged on, the load average jumps quickly over 20 due to silly
implementation of the user databases. For a quite similar disease, compare \citeentry{HP-SUX}. Also, compare \citeentry{Macintrash},
\citeentry{Nominal Semidestructor}, \citeentry{ScumOS}, \citeentry{sun-stools}.
