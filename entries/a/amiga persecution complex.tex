\mainentry{Amiga Persecution Complex} n.

The disorder suffered by a particularly eggregious variety of \citeentry{bigot}, those who believe that the marginality of their preferred
machine is the result of some kind of industry-wide conspiracy (for without a conspiracy of some kind, the eminent superiority of their
beloved shining jewel of a platform would obviously win over all, market pressures be damned!) Those afflicted are prone to engaging in
\citeentry{flame war}s and calling for boycotts and mailbombings. Amica Persecution Complex is by no means limited to Amiga users; Haskell,
Windows (as being ``cool'', as the editor remembers from his carefree, pre-GNU/Linux-using days --yasht), Macintosh, \citeentry{LISP} and
\citeentry{GNU} users are also common victoms. \citeentry{GNU/Linux} users used to display symptoms very frequently before GNU/Linux started
winning; some still do. See also \citeentry{newbie}, \citeentry{troll}, \citeentry{holy wars}, \citeentry{weenie}, \citeentry{Get a life!}.
