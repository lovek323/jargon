\mainentry{ADVENT} /ad-vent/ n.

The prototypical computer adventure game, first designed by Will Crowther on the \citeentry{PDP-10} in the mid-1970s as an attempt at
computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. (Woods had been one of the
authors of \citeentry{INTERCAL}.) Now better known as Adventure, but the \citeentry{TOPS-10} operating system permitted only six-letter
filenames. See also \citeentry{vadding}, \citeentry{Zork}, and \citeentry{Infocom}.

This game defined the terse, dryly humorous style since expected in text adventure games, and popularized several tag lines that have become
fixtures of hacker-speak: ``A huge green fierce snake bars the way!'' ``I see no X here'' (for some noun X). ``You are in a maze of twisty
little passages, all alike.'' ``You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.'' The `magic words' \citeentry{xyzzy} and
\citeentry{plugh} also derive from this game.

Crowther, by the way, participated in the exploration of the Mammoth \& Flint Ridge cave system; it actually has a `Colossal Cave' and a
`Bedquilt' as in the game, and the `Y2' that also turns up is cavers' jargon for a map reference to a secondary entrance.
