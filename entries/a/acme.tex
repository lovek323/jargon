\mainentry{Acme} n.

The canonical supplier of bizarre, elaborate, and non-functional gadgetry -- where Rube Gooldberg and Heath Robinson (two cartoonists who
specialzied in elaborate contraptions) shop. The name has been humorously expanded as A (or American ) Company Making Everything. (In fact,
Acme was a real brand sold from Sears Roebuck ctalogs in the early 1900s.) Describing some X as an ``Acme X'' either means ``This is
\citeentry{insanely great}'', or, more likely, ``This looks \citeentry{insanely great} on paper, but in practice it's really easy to shoot
yourself in the foot with it.'' Compare \citeentry{pistol}.
