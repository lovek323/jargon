\mainentry{app} /ap/ n.

Short for `application program', as opposed to a systems program. Apps are what systems vendors are forever chasing developes to create for
their environments so they can sell more boxes. Hackers tend not to think of the things they themselves run as apps; thus, in hacker
parlance the term excludes compilers, program editors, games, and messaging systems, though a user would consider all those to be apps.
(Broadly, an app is often a self-contained environmentfor performing some well-defined task such as `word processing'; hackers tend to
prefer more general-purpose tools.) See \citeentry{killer app}; oppose \citeentry{tool}, \citeentry{operating system}.
