\mainentry{all-elbows} adj.

[MS-DOS] Of a TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) IBM PC program, such as the N pop-up calendar and calculator utilities that circulate on
\citeentry{BBS} systems: unsociable. Used to describe a program that rudely steals the resources that it needs without considering that
other TSRs may also be resident. One particularly common form of rudeness is lock-up due to programs fighting over the keyboard interrupt.
See \citeentry{rude}, also \citeentry{mess-dos}.
