\mainentry{asbestos cork award} n.

Once, long ago at MIT, there was a \citeentry{flamer} so consistently obnoxious that another hacker designed, had made, and distributed
posters announcing that said flamer had been nominated for the `asbestos cork award'. (Any reader in doubt as to the intended application of
the cork should consult the etymology under \citeentry{flame}.) Since then, it is agreed that only a select few have risen to the heights of
bombast required to earn this dubious dignity -- but there is no agreement on which few.
