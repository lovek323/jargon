\mainentry{angry fruit salad} n.

A bad visual-interface design that uses too many colors. (This term derives, of course, from the bizarre day-glo colors found in canned
fruit salad.) Too often one sees similar effects from interface designers using color window systems such as \citeentry{X}; there is a
tendency to create displays that are flashy and attention-getting but uncomfortable for long-term use.
