\mainentry{airplane rule} n.

``Complexity increases the possibility of failure; a twin-engine airplane has twice as many engine problems as a single-engine airplane.''
By analogy, in both software and electronics, the rule that simplicity increases robustness. It is correspondingly argued that the right way
to build reliable systems is to put all your eggs in one basket, after making sure that you've built a really good basket. See also
