\mainentry{Angband} n. /ang'band/

Like \citeentry{nethack}, \citeentry{moria}, \citeentry{rogue}, one of the large freely distributed Dungeons-and-Dragons-like simulation
games, available for a wide range of machines and operating systems. The name is from Tolkien's Pits of Angband (compare \citeentry{elder
days}, \citeentry{elvish}). Has been described as ``Moria on steroids''; but, unlike Moria, many aspects of the game are customizable. This
leads many hackers and would-be hackers into fooling with these instead of doing productive work. There are many Angband variants, of which
the most notorious is probably the rather whimsical Zangband. In this game, when a key that does not correspond to a command is pressed, the
game will display ``Type ? for help'' 50\% of the time. The other 50\% of the time, random error messages including ``An error has occurred
because an error of type 42 has occurred'' and ``Windows 95 uninstalled successfully'' will be displayed. Zangband also allows the player to
kill Santa Claus (who has some really good stuff, but also has a lot of friends), ``Bull Gates'', and Barney the Dinosaur (but be watchful;
Barney has a nasty case of halitosis). There is an official Angband home page at \url{http://www.phial.com/angband} and a zangband one at
