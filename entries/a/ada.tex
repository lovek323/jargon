\mainentry{Ada} n.

A \citeentry{Pascal}-descended language that has been made mandatory for Department of Defense software projects by the Pentagon. Hackers
are nearly unanimous in observing that, technically, it is precisely what one might expect given that kind of endorsement by fiat; designed
by committee, crockish, difficult to use, and overall a disastrous, multi-billion-dollar boondoggle (one common description was ``The PL/I
of the 190s''). Hackers find Ada's exception-handling and inter-process communication features particularly hilarious. Ada Lovelace (the
daughter of Lord Byron who became the world's first programmer while cooperating with Charles Babbage on the design of his mechanical
computer engines in the mid-1800s) would almost certainly blanch at the use to which her name has latterly been put; the kindest thing that
has been said about it is that there is probably a good small language screaming to get out from inside its vast, \citeentry{elephantine}
bulk.
