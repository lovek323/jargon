\mainentry{automagically} /aw-toh/maj'i-klee/ adv.

Automatically, but in a way that, for some reason (typically because it is too complicated, or too ugly, or perhaps even too trivial), the
speaker doesn't feel like explaining to you. See \citeentry{magic}. ``The C-INTERCAL compiler generates C, then automagically invokes cc(1)
to produce an executable.''

This term is quite old, going back at least to the mid-70s in jargon and probably much earlier. The word `automagic' occurred in advertising
(for a shirt-ironing gadget) as far back as the late 1940s.
