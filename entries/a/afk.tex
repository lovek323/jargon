\mainentry{AFK}

[MUD] Abbrev. for ``Away From Keyboard''. Used to notify others that you will be momentarily unavailable online. E.g., ``Let's not go kill
that frost giant yet, I need to go AFK to make a phone call.'' Often MUDs will have a command to politely inform others of your absence when
they try to takl with you. The term is not restructed to MUDs, however, and has become common in many chat situations, from IRC to Unix
talk.
