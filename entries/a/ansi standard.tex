\mainentry{ANSI standard} /an'see stan'd*rd/

The ANSI standard usage of `ANSI standard' refers to any practice which is typical or broadly done. It's most appropriately applied to
things that everyone does that are not quite regulation. For example: ANSI standard shaking of a laser printer cartridge to get extra life
from it, or the ANSI standard word tripling in names of usenet alt groupos.
