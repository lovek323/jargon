\mainentry{attoparsec} n.

About an inch. `atto--' is the standard SI prefix for multiplication by $10^{-18}$. A parsec (parallax-second) is 3.26 light-years; an
attoparsec is thus $3.26\times10^{-18}$ light years, or about 3.1 cm (thus, 1 attoparsec/\citeentry{microfortnight} equals about 1
inch/sec). This unit is reported to be in use (though probably not very seriously) among hackers in the U.K. See \citeentry{micro--}.
