\mainentry{astroturfing} n.

The use of paid shills to create the impression of popular movement, thoguh means like letters to newspapers from soi-disant `concerned
citizens', paid opinion pieces, and the formation of grass-roots lobbying groups that are actually funded by a PR group ( astroturf is fake
grass; hence the term). This term became common among hackers after it came to light in early 1998 that Microsoft had attempted to use such
tactics to forestall the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust action against the company.

This backfired horribly, angering a number of state attorneys-general enough to induce them to go public with plans to join the Federal
suit. It also set anybody defending Microsoft on the net for the accusation ``You're just astroturfing!''.
