\mainentry{address harvester} n.

A robot that searches web pages and/or filters netnews traffic looking for valid email addresses. Some address harvesters are benign, used
only for compiling address directories. Most, unfortunately, are run by miscreants compiling address lists to \citeentry{spam}. Address
harvesters can be foiled by a \citeentry{teergrube}.
