\mainentry{suit} n.

\begin{inparaenum}
	\item Ugly and uncomfortable `business clothing' often worn by non-hackers. Invariably worn with a `tie', a strangulation device that
		partially cuts off the blood supply to the brain. It is thought that this explains much about the behavior of suit-wearers. Compare
		\citeentry{droid}.
	\item A person who habitually wears suits, as distinct from a techie or hacker. See \citeentry{pointy-haired}, \citeentry{burble},
		\citeentry{management}, \citeentry{Stupids}, \citeentry{SNAFU principle}, \citeentry{PHB}, and \citeentry{brain-damaged}.
