\mainentry{September that never ended}

All time since September 1993. One of the seasonal rhythms of the Usenet used to be the annual September influx of clueless newbies who,
lacking any sense of \citeentry{netiquette}, made a general nuisance of themselves. This coincided with people starting college, getting
their first internet accounts, and plunging in without bothering to learn what was acceptable. These relatively small drafts of newbies
could be assimilated within a few months. But in September 1993, AOL users became able to post to Usenet, nearly overwhelming the
old-timers' capacity to acculturate them; to those who nostalgically recall the period before hand, this triggered an inexorable decline in
the quality of discussions on newsgroups. See also \citeentry{AOL!}.
