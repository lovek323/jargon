\mainentry{frob} /frob/

\begin{inparaenum}
	\item n.

		[MIT; very common] The \citeentry{TMRC} definition was ``FROB = a protruding arm or trunnion''; by metaphoric extension, a `frob'
		is any random small thing, an object that you can comfortably hold in one hand; something you can frob (sense 2). See
		\citeentry{frobnitz}.
	\item vt. Abbreviated form of \citeentry{frobnicate}.
	\item [from the \citeentry{MUD} world] A command on some MUDs that changes a player's experience level (this can be used to make
		wizards); also, to request \citeentry{wizard} privileges on the `professional courtesy' grounds that one is a wizard elsewhere. The
		command is actually `frobnicate' but is universally abbreviated to the shorter form.
