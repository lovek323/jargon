\mainentry{bogo-sort} /boh`goh-sort'/ n.

(var. `stupid-sort') The archetypical perversely awful algorithm (as opposed to
\citeentry{bubble sort}, which is merely the generic bad algorithm). Bogo-sort
is equivalent to repeatedly throwing a deck of cards in the air, picking them up
at random, and then testing whether they are in order. It serves as a sort of
canonical example of awfulness. Looking at a program and seeing a dumb
algorithm, one might say ``Oh, I see, this program uses bogo-sort.'' Esp.
appropriate for algorithms with factorial or super-exponential running time in
the average case and probabilistically infinite worst-case running time. Compare
\citeentry{bogus}, \citeentry{brute force}, \citeentry{lasherism}.

A spectacular variant of bogo-sort has been proposed which has the interesting
property that, if the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum physics is true, it
can sort an arbitrarily large array in constant time. (In the Many-Worlds model,
the result of any quantum mechanics is to split the universes-before into a
sheaf of universes-after, one for each possible way the state vector can
collapse; in any one of the universes-after the result appears random.) The
steps are: 1. Permute the array randomly using a quantum process, 2. If the
array is not sorted, destroy the universe. Implementation of step 2 is left as
an exercise for the reader.
