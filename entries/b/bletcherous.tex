\mainentry{bletcherous} /blech'*-r*s/ adj.

Disgusting in design or function; esthetically unappealing. This word is seldom
used of people. ``This keyboard is bletcherous!'' (Perhaps the keys don't work
very well, or are misplaced.) See \citeentry{losing}, \citeentry{cretinous}. By
contrast, something that is `losing' or `bagbiting' may be failing to meet
objective criteria. See also \citeentry{bogus} and \citeentry{random}, which
have richer and wider shades of meaning than any of the above.
