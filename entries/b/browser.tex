\mainentry{browser} n.

A program specifically designed to help users view and navigate hypertext,
on-line documentation, or a database. While this general sense has been present
in jargon for a long time, the proliferation of browsers for the World Wide Web
after 1992 has made it much more popular and provided a central or default
meaning of the word previously lacking in hacker usage. Nowadays, if someone
mentions using a `browser' without qualification, one may assume it's a Web
browser.
