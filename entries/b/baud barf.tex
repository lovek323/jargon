\mainentry{baud barf} /bawd barf/ n.

The garbage one gets \textlangle from\textrangle\ a terminal (or terminal
emulator) when using a modem connection with some some protocol setting (esp.
line speed) incorrect, or when someone picks up a voice extension on the same
line, or when really bad line noise disrupts the connection. Baud barf is not
completely \citeentry{random}, by the way; hackers with a lot of serial-line
experience can usually tell whether the device at the other end is expecting a
higher or lower speed than the terminal is set to. Really experienced ones can
identify particular speeds.
