\mainentry{batbelt} n.

Many hackers routinely hang numerous devices such as pagers, cell-phones,
personal organizers, leatherman multitools, pocket knives, flashlights,
walkie-talkies, even miniature computers from their belts. When many of these
devices are worn at once, the hacker's belt somewhat resembles Batman's utility
belt; hence it is referred to as a batbelt.
