\mainentry{bitblt} /bit'blit/ n.

[FROM \citeentry{BLT}, q.v.]
\begin{inparaenum}
\item {[}common] Any of a family of closely related algorithms for moving
    and copying rectangles of bits between main and display memory on a
    bit-mapped device, or between two areas of either main or display memory
    (the requirement to do the \citeentry{Right Thing} in the case of
    overlapping source and destination rectangles is what makes
    bitblt\Changes{This was originally `BitBlt', but I changed it to `bitblt'
    for consistency.} tricky).
\item Synonym for \citeentry{blit} or \citeentry{BLT}. Both uses are
    borderline techspeak.
\end{inparaenum}
