\mainentry{Black Screen of Death} n.

[prob. related to the Floating Head of Death in a famous ``Far Side'' cartoon.]
A failure mode of \citeentry{Microsloth Windows}. On an attempt to launch a DOS
box, a networked Windows system not uncommonly blanks the screen and locks up
the PC so hard that it requires a cold \citeentry{boot} to recover. This unhappy
phenomenon is known as The Black Screen of Death. See also \citeentry{Blue
Screen of Death}, which has become rather more common.
