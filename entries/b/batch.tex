\mainentry{batch} adj.

\begin{inparaenum}
    \item Non-interactive. Hackers use this somewhat more loosely than the
        traditional technical definitions justify; in particular, switches on a
        normally interactive program that prepare it to receive non-interactive
        command input are often referrred to as `batch mode' switches. A `batch
        file' is a series of instructions written to be handed to an interactive
        program running in batch mode.
    \item Performance of dreary tasks all at one sitting. ``I finally sat down
        in batch mode and wrote out checks for all those bills; I guess they'll
        turn the electricity back on next week\ldots''
    \item `batching up': Accumulation of a number of small tasks that can be
        lumped together for greater efficiency. ``I'm batching up those letters
        to send sometime'' ``I'm batching up bottles to take to the recycling
        center.''
