\mainentry{Big Red Switch} n.

[IBM] The power switch on a computer, esp. the `Emergency Pull' switch
on an IBM \citeentry{mainframe} or the power swithc on an IBM PC where
it really is large and red. ``This !@\%\$\% \citeentry{bitty box} is
hung again; time to hit the Big Red Switch.'' Sources at IBM report
that, in tune with the company's passion for \citeentry{TLA}s, this is
often abbreviated as `BRS' (this has also become established on FidoNet
and in the PC \citeentry{clone} world). It is alleged that the emergency
pull switch on an IBM 360/91 actually fired a non-conducting bolt into
the main power feed; the BRSes on more recent mainframes physically drop
a block into place so that they can't be pushed back in. People get
fired for pulling them, especially inappropriately (see also
\citeentry{molly-guard}). Compare \citeentry{power cycle},
\citeentry{three-finger salute}, \citeentry{120 reset}; see also
\citeentry{scram switch}.
