\mainentry{BLT} /B-L-T/, /bl*t/ or (rarely) /belt/ n.,vt.

Synonym for \citeentry{blit}. This is the original form of \citeentry{blit} and
the ancestor of \citeentry{bitblt}. It referred to any large bit-field copy or
move operation (one resource-intensive memory-shuffling operation done on
pre-paged versions of ITS, WAITS, and TOPS-10 was sardonically referred to as
`The Big BLT'). The jargon usage has outlasted the \citeentry{PDP-10}
Block \Changes{Was `BLock', but this is clearly incorrect.}
Transfer instruction from which BLT \Changes{Was a link to the \textit{BLT}
entry. Since this is the \textit{BLT} entry, I have removed the link.} derives;
nowadays, the assembler mnemonic BLT \Changes{Was a link to the \textit{BLT}
entry.} almost always means `Branch if Less Than Zero'.
