\mainentry{brain dump} n.

[common] The act of telling someone everything one knows about a particular
topic or project. Typically used when someone is going to let a new party
maintain a piece of code. Conceptually analogous to an operating system
\citeentry{core dump} in that it saves a lot of useful \citeentry{state} before
an exit. ``You'll have to give me a brain dump on FOOBAR before you start your
new job at HackerCorp.'' See \citesense{core dump}{4}. At Sun, this is also
known as `TOI' (transfer of information).
