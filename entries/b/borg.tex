\mainentry{Borg} n.

In ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' the Borg is a species of cyborg that
ruthlessly seeks to incorporate all sentient life into itself; their slogan is
``Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.'' In hacker parlance, the Borg
is usually \citeentry{Microsoft}, which is thought to be trying just as
ruthlessly to assimilate all computers and the entire Internet to itself (there
is a widely circulated image of Bill Gates as a Borg). Being forced to use
Windows OR NT is often referred to as being ``Borged''. Interestingly, the
\citeentry{Halloween Documents} reveal that this jargon is live within Microsoft
itself. (Other companies, notably Intel and UUNet have also occasionally been
equated to the Borg.) See also \citeentry{Evil Empire}, \citeentry{Internet
Exploiter}.
