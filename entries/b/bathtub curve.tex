\mainentry{bathtub curve} n.

Common term for the curve (resembling an end-to-end section of one of those
claw-footed antique bathtubs) that describes the expected failure rate of
electronics with time: initially high, dropping to near 0 for most of the
system's lifetime, then rising again as it `tires out'. See also
