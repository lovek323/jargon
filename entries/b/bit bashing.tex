\mainentry{bit bashing} n.

(alt. `bit diddling' or \citeentry{bit twiddling}) Term used to describe any of
several kinds of low-level programming characterized by manipulation of
\citeentry{bit}, \citeentry{flag}, \citeentry{nybble}, and other
smaller-than-character-sized pieces of data; these include low-level device
control, encryption algorithms, checksum and error-correcting codes, hash
functions, some flavors of graphics programming (see \citeentry{bitblt}), and
assembler/compiler code generation. May connote either tedium or a real
technical challenge (more usually the former). ``The command decoding for the
new tape driver looks pretty solid but the bit-bashing for the control registers
still has bugs.'' See also \citeentry{bit bang}, \citeentry{mode bit}.
