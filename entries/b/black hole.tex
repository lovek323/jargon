\mainentry{black hole} n.,vt.

[common] What data (a piece of email or netnews, or a stream of TCP/IP packets)
has fallen into if it disappears mysteriously between its origin and destination
sites (that is, without returning a \citeentry{bounce message}). ``I think
there's a black hole at foovax!'' conveys suspicion that site foovax has been
dropping a lot of stuff on the floor lately (see \citeentry{drop on floor}). The
implied metaphor of email as interstellar travel is interesting in itself.
Readily verbed as `blackhole': ``That router is blackholing IDP packets.''
Compare \citeentry{bit bucket} and see \citeentry{RBL}.
