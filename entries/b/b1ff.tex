n.

The most famous \citeentry{pseudo}, and the prototypical \citeentry{newbie}.
Articles from B1FF feature all uppercase letters sprinkled liberally with bangs,
typos, `cute' misspellings (``EVRY BUDY LUVS GOOD OLD BIFF CUZ HE"S A K00L DOOD
AN HE RITES REEL AWESUM THINGZ IN CAPITULL LETTRS LIKE THIS!!!''\footnote{There
were no closing quotes. I added them. ---JDO}, use (and often misuse) of
fragments of \citeentry{talk mode} abbreviations, a long \citeentry{sig block}
(sometimes even a \citeentry{doubled sig}), and unbounded naivete. B1FF posts
articles using his elder brother's VIC-20. B1FF's location is a mystery, as his
articles appear to come from a variety of sites. However, \citeentry{BITNET}
seems to be the most frequent origin. The theory that B1FF is a denizen of
BITNET is supported by B1FF's (unfortunately invalid) electronic mail address:
B1FF@BIT.NET.

[1993: Now It Can Be Told! My spies inform me that B1FF was originally created
by Joe Talmadge <jat@cup.hp.com>, also the author of the infamous and
much-plagiarized ``Flamer's Bible''. The BIFF filter he wrote was later passed
to Richard Sexton, who posted BIFFisms much more widely. Versions have since
been posted for the amusement of the net at large. --ESR]
