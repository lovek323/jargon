\mainentry{backbone cabal} n.

A group of large-site administrators who pushed through the \citeentry{Great
Renaming} and reined in the chaos of \citeentry{Usenet} during most of the
1980s. During most of its lifetime, the Cabal (as it was sometimes capitalized)
steadfastly deined its own existence; it was almost obligatory for anyone privy
to their secrets to respond ``There is no Cabal'' whenever the existence or
activities of the group were speculated on in public.

The result of this policy was an attractive aura of mystery. Even a decade after
the cabal \citeentry{mailing list} disbanded in late 1988 following a bitter
internal catfight, many people believed (or claimed to believe) that it had not
actually disbanded but only gone deeper underground with its power intact.

This belief became a model for various paranoid theories about various Cabals
with dark nefarious objectives beginning with taking over the Usenet or
Internet. These paranoias were later satirized in ways that took on a life of
their own. See \citeentry{Eric Conspiracy} for one example.

See \citeentry{NANA} for the subsequent history of ``the Cabal''.
