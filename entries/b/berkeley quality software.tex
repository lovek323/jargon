\mainentry{Berkeley Quality Software} adj.

(often abbreviated `BQS') Term used in a pejorative sense to refer to software
that was apparently created by rather spaced-out hackers late at night to solve
some unique problem. It usually has nonexistent, incomplete, or incorrect
documentation, has been tested on at least two examples, and core dumps when
anyone else attempts to use it. This term was frequently applied to early
versions of the dbx(1) debugger. See also \citeentry{Berzerkeley}.
