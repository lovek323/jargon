\mainentry{bogon flux} /boh'gon fulhks/ n.

A measure of supposed field of \citeentry{bogosity} emitted by a speaker,
measured by a \citeentry{bogometer}; as a speaker starts to wander into
increasingly bogosity a listener might say ``Warning, warning, bogon flux is
rising''. See \citeentry{quantum bogodynamics}.
