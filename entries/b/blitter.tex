\mainentry{blitter} /blit'r/ n.

[common] A special-purpose chip or hardware system built to perform
\citeentry{blit} operations, esp. used for fast implementation of bit-mapped
graphics. The Commodore Amiga and a few other micros have these, but since 1990
the trend has been away from them (however, see \citeentry{cycle of
reincarnation}). Syn. \citeentry{raster blaster}.
