\mainentry{bonk/oif} /bonk/, /oyf/ interj.

In the U.S. \citeentry{MUD} community, it has become traditional to express
pique or censure by `bonking' the offending person. Convention holds that one
should acknowledge a bonk by saying `oif!' and there is a myth to the effect
that failing to do so upsets the cosmic bonk/oif balance, causing much trouble
in the universe. Some MUDs have implemented special commands for bonking and
oifing. Note: in parts of the U.K. `bonk' is a sexually loaded slang term; care
is advised in transatlantic conversations. Commonwealth hackers report a similar
convention involving the `fish/bang' balance. See also \citeentry{talk mode}.
