\mainentry{broket}

[rare; by analogy with `bracket': a `broken bracket'] Either of the characters
$<$ and $>$, when used as paired enclosing delimiters. This word originated as a
contraction of the phrase `broken bracket', that is, a bracket that is bent in
the middle. (At MIT, and apparently in the \citeentry{Real World} as well, these
are usually called \citeentry{angle brackets}.)
