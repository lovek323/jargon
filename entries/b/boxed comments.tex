\mainentry{boxed comments} n.

Comments (explanatory notes attached to program instructions) that occopy
several lines by themselves; so called because in assembler and C code they are
often surrounded by a box in a style something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
 /*************************************************
  *
  * This is a boxed comment in C style
  *
  *************************************************/
\end{verbatim}

Common variants of this style omit the asterisks in column 2 or add a matching
row of asterisks closing the right side of the box. The sparest variant omits
all but the comment delimiters themselves; the `box' is implied. Oppose
\citeentry{winged comments}.
