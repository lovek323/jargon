\mainentry{block transfer computations} n.

[from the television series ``Dr. Who''] Computations so fiendishly subtle and
complex that they could not be performed by machines. Used to refer to any task
that should be expressible as an algorithm in theory, but isn't. (The Z80's LIDR
instruction, ``Computed Block Transfer with increment'', may also be relevant.)
