\mainentry{blue box} n.

\begin{inparaenum}
\item obs. Once upon a time, before all-digital switches made it possible for
    the phone companies to move them out of band, one could actually hear the
    switching tones used to route long-distance calls. Early
    \citeentry{phreaker}s built devices called `blue boxes' that could reproduce
    these tones, which could be used to commandeer portions of the phone
    network. (This was not as hard as it may sound; one early phreak acquired
    the sobriquet `Captain Crunch' after he provided that he could generated
    switching tones with a plastic whistle pulled out of a box of Captain Crunch
    cereal!) There were other colors of box with more specialized phreaking
    uses; red boxes, black boxes, silver boxes, etc.
\item n. An \citeentry{IBM} machine, especially a large (non-PC) one.
