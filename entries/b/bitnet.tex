\mainentry{BITNET} /bit'net/ n., obs.

[acronym; Because It's Time NETwork] Everybody's least favorite piece of the
network (see \citeentry{the network}) -- until AOL happened. The BITNET hosts
were a collection of IBM dinosaurs and VAXen (the latter with lobotomized comm
hardware) that communicate using 80-character \citeentry{EBCDIC} card images
(see \citeentry{eight-column mind}); thus, they tend to mangle the headers and
text of third-party traffic from the rest of the ASCII\citeentry{RFC}-822 world
with annoying regularity. BITNET was also notorious as the apparent home of
\citeentry{B1FF}. By 1955 it had, much to everyone's relief, been obsolesced and
absorbed into the Internet. Unfortunately, around this time we also got AOL.
