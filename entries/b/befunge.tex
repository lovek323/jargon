\mainentry{Befunge} n.

A worthy companion to \citeentry{INTERCAL}; a computer language family which
escapes the quotidian limitation of linear control flow and embraces program
counters flying through multiple dimensions with exotic topologies. Sadly, the
Befunge home page has vanished, but a Befunge version of the \citeentry{hello
world} program is at \url{http://www.latech.edu/~acm/helloworld/befunge.html}.
