\mainentry{blue wire} n.

[IBM] Patch wires (esp. 30 AWG gauge) added to circuit boards at the factory to
correct design or fabrication problems. Blue wire is not necessarily blue, the
term describes function rather than color. These may be necessary if there
hasn't been time to design and qualify another board version. Compare
\citeentry{purple wire}, \citeentry{red wire}, \citeentry{yellow wire},
\citeentry{pink wire}.
