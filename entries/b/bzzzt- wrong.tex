\mainentry{Bzzzt! Wrong}\opt{changes}{\footnote{There was a full stop here.}}
/bzt rong/ excl.

[common; Usenet/Internet; punctuation varies] From a Robbin Williams routine in
the movie ``Dead Poets Society'' spoofing radio or TV quiz programs, such as
Truth or Consequences, where an incorrect answer earns one a blast from the
buzzer and condolences from the interlocutor. A way of expressing mock-rude
disagreement, usually immediately followed from an included quote from another
poster. The less abbreviated ``*Bzzzzt*, wrong, but thank you for playing'' is
also common; capitalization and emphasis of the buzzer sound varies.
