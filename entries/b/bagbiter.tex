		works in a remarkably clumsy manner. ``This text editor won't let me
		make a file with a line longer than 80 characters! What a bagbiter!''
	\item A person who has caused you some trouble, inadvertently or otherwise,
		typically by failing to program the computer properly. Synonyms:
		\citeentry{loser}, \citeentry{cretin}, \citeentry{chomper}.
	\item `bite the bag' vi. To fail in some manner. ``The computer keeps
		crashing every five minutes.'' ``Yes, the disk controller is really
		biting the bag.''
\end{inparaenum}

The original loading of these terms was almost undoubtedly obscene, possibly
referring to a douche bag or the scrotum (we have reports of ``Bite the douche
bag!'' being used as an insult at MIT 1970--1976), but in their current usage
they have become almost completely sanitized.

ITS's \citeentry{lexiphage} program was the first and to date only known example
of a program intended to be a bagbiter.
