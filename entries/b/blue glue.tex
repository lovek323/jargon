\mainentry{Blue Glue} n.

[IBM] IBM's SNA (System Network Architecture), an incredibly \citeentry{losing}
and \citeentry{bletcherous} communications protocol widely favored at commercial
shops that don't know any better. The official IBM definition is ``that which
binds blue boxes together.'' See \citeentry{fear and loathing}. It may not be
irrelevant that Blue Glue is the trade name of a 3M product that is commonly
used to hold down the carpet squares to the removable panel floors common in
\citeentry{dinosaur pen}s. A correspondent at U. Minn. reports that the CS
department there has about 80 bottles of the stuff hanging about, so they often
refer to any messy work to be done as `using the blue glue'.
