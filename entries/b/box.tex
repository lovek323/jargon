\mainentry{box} n.

\begin{inparaenum}
\item A computer; esp. in the construction `foo box' where foo is some
    functional qualifier, like `graphics', or the name of an OS (thus, `Unix
    box', `MS-DOS box', etc.) ``We preprocess the data on Unix boxes before
    handing it up to the mainframe.'' 
\item {[}IBM] Without qualification but within an SNA-using site, this refers
    specifically to an IBM front-end processor or FEP /F-E-P/. An FEP is a small
    computer necessary to enable an IBM \citeentry{mainframe} to communicate
    beyond the limits of the \citeentry{dinosaur pen}. Typically used in
    expressions like the cry that goes up when an SNA network goes down: ``Looks
    like the box has fallen over.'' (See \citeentry{fall over}.) See also
    \citeentry{IBM}, \citeentry{fear and loathing}, \citeentry{Blue Glue}.
