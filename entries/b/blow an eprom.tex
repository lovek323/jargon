\mainentry{blow an EPROM} /boh *n ee'prom/ v.

(alt. `blast an EPROM', `burn an EPROM') To program a read-only memory, e.g. for
use with an embedded system. This term arose because the programming process for
the Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs) that preceded present-day Erasable
Programmable Read-Only Memories (EPROMs) involved intentionally blowing tiny
electrical fuses on the chip. The usage lives on (it's too vivid and expressive
to discard) even though the write process on EPROMs is nondestructive.
