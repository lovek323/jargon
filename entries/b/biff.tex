\mainentry{biff} /bif/ vt.

To notify someone of incoming mail. From the BSD utility biff(1), which
was in turn named after a friendly dog who used to chase frisbees in the
halls at UCB while 4.2BSD was in development. There was a legend that it
had a habit of barking whenever the mailman came, but the author of biff
says this is not true. No relation to \citeentry{B1FF}.
