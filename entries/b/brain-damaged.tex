\mainentry{brain-damaged} adj.

\begin{inparaenum}
\item {[}common; generalization of `Honeywell Brain Damage' (HBD), a theoretical
        disease invented to explain certain utter cretinisms in Honeywell
    \citeentry{Multics}] adj. Obviously wrong; \citeentry{cretinous};
    \citeentry{demented}. There is an implication that the person responsible
    must have suffered brain damage, because he should have known better.
    Calling something brain-damaged is really bad; it also implies it is
    unusable, and that its failure to work is due to poor design rather than
    some accident. ``Only six monocase characters per file name? Now that's
    braindamaged!''
\item {[}esp. in the Mac world] May refer to free demonstration software that
    has been deliberately crippled in some way so as not to compete with the
    product it is intended to sell. Syn. \citeentry{crippleware}.
