\mainentry{bug-of-the-month club} n.

[from ``book-of-the-month club'', a time-honored mail-order-marketing technique
in the U.S.] A mythical club which users of `sendmail(8)' (the UNIX mail daemon)
belong to; this was coined on the Usenet newsgroup comp.security.unix at a time
when sendmail security holes, which allowed outside \citeentry{cracker}s access
to the system, were being uncovered at an alarming rate, forcing sysadmins to
update very often. Also, more completely, `fatal security bug-of-the-month
club'.
