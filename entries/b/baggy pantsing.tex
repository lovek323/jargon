\mainentry{baggy pantsing} v.

[Georgia Tech] A ``baggy pantsing'' is used to reprimand hackers who
incautiously leave their terminals unlocked. The affected user will come back to
find a post from them on internal newsgroups discussing exactly how baggy their
pants are, an accepted stand-in for ``unattentive user who left their work
unprotected in the clusters''. A properly-done baggy pantsing is highly mocking
and humorous (see examples below). It is considered bad form to post a baggy
pantsing to off-campus newsgroups or the more technical, serious groups. A
particularly nice baggy pantsing may be ``claimed'' by immediately quoting the
message in full, followed by your sig; this has the added benefit of keeping the
embarassed victim from being able to delete the post. Interesting
baggy-pantsings have been done involving adding commands to login scripts to
repost the message every time the unlucky user logs in; Unix boxes on the
residential network, when cracked, oftentimes have their homepages replaced
(after being politely backedup to another file) with a baggy-pants message;
.plan files are also occasionally targeted. Usage: ``Prof. Greenlee fell asleep
in the Solaris cluster again; we baggy-pantsed him to git.cc.class.2430.flame.''
