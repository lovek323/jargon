\mainentry{bells and whistles} n.

[common] Features added to a program or system to make it more
\citeentry{flavorful} from a hacker's point of view, without necessarily adding
to its utility for its primary function. Distinguished from \citeentry{chrome},
which is intended to attract users. ``Now that we've got the basic program
working, let's go back and add some bells and whistles.'' No one seems to know
what distinguishes a bell from a whistle. The recognized emphatic form is
``bells, whistles, and gongs''.

It used to be thought that this term derived from the toyboxes on theater
organs. However, the ``and gongs'' strongly suggests a different origin, at sea.
Before powered horns, ships routinely used bells, whistles, and gongs to signal
each other over longer distances than voice can carry.
