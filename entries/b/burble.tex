\mainentry{burble} v.

[from Lewis Carroll's ``Jabberwocky''] Like \citeentry{flame}, but connotes that
the source is truly clueless and ineffectual (mere flamers can be competent). A
term of deep contempt. ``There's some guy on the phone burbling about how he got
a DISK FULL error and it's all our comm software's fault.'' This is mainstream
slang in some parts of England.
