\mainentry{BiCapitalization} n.

The act said to have been performed on trademarks (such as PostScript, NeXT,
NeWS, VisiCalc, FrameMaker, TK!solver, EasyWriter) that have been raised above
the ruck of common coinage by nonstandard capitalization. Too many marketroid
types think this sort of thing is really cute, even the 2,317th time they do it.
