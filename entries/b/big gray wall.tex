\mainentry{Big Gray Wall} n.

What faces a \citeentry{VMS} user searching for documentation. A full
WMS kit comes on a pallet, the documentation taking up around 15 feet of
shelf space before the addition of layered products such as compilers,
databases, multivendor networking, and programming tools. Recent (since
VMS version 5) documentation comes with gray binders; under VMS version
4 the binders were orange (`big orange wall'), and under version 3 they
were blue. See \citeentry{VMS}. Often contracted to `Gray Wall'.
