\mainentry{bread crumbs} n.

Debugging statements inserted into a program that emit output or log indicators
of the program's \citeentry{state} to a file so you can see where it dies or pin
down the cause of surprising behavior. The term is probably a reference to the
Hansel and Gretel story from the Brothers Grimm or the older French folktale of
Thumbelina; in several variants of these, a character leaves a trail of bread
crumbs so as not to get lost in the woods.
