\mainentry{baroque} adj.

[common] Feature-encrusted; complex; gaudy; verging on excessive. Said of
hardware or (esp.) software designs, this has many of the connotations of
\citeentry{elephantine} or \citeentry{monstrosity} but is less extreme and not
pejorative in itself. ``Metafont even has features to introduce random
variations to its letterform output. Now that is baroque!'' See also
\citeentry{rococo}.
