\mainentry{BOFH} // n.

[common] Acronym, Bastard Operator From Hell. A system administrator with
absolutely no tolerance for \citeentry{luser}s. ``You say you need more
filespace? <massive-global-delete> Seems to me you have plenty left\dots'' Many
BOFHs (and others who would be BOFHs if they could get away with it) hang out in
the newsgroup alt.sysadmin.recovery, although there has also been created a
top-level newsgroup hierarchy (bofh.*) of their own.

Several people have written stories about BOFHs. The set usually considered
canonical is by Simon Travaglia and may be found at the Bastard Home Page,
\url{http://prime-mover.cc.waikato.ac.nz/Bastard.html}. BOFHs and BOFH wannabes
hang out on \citeentry{scary devil monastery} and wield \citeentry{LART}s.
