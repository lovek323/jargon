\mainentry{balloonian variable} n.

[Commodore users; perh. a deliberate phonetic mangling of `boolean variable'?]
Any variable that doesn't actually hold or control state, but must nevertheless
be declared, checked, or set. A typical balloonian variable started out as a
flag attached to some environment feature that either became obsolete or was
planned but never implemented.

Compatibility concerns (or politics attached to same) may require that such a
flag be treated as though it were \citeentry{live}.
