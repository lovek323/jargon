\mainentry{BogoMIPS}

The number of million times a second a processor can do absolutely nothing. The
\citeentry{GNU/Linux} OS measures BogoMIPS at startup in order to calibrate some
soft timing loops that will be used later on; details at the BogoMIPS mini-HOWTO
(\url{http://www.hobby.nl/~7Eclifton}). The name Linus chose, of course, is an
ironic comment on the uselessness of all other \citeentry{MIPS} figures.
