\mainentry{backbone site} n.,obs.

Formerly, a key Usenet and email site, one that processes a large amount of
third-party traffic, especially if it is the home site of any of the regional
coordinators for the Usenet maps. Notable backbone sites as of early 1993, when
this sense of the term was beginning to pass out of general use due to wide
availability of cheap Internet connections, included uunet and the mail machines
at Rutgers University, UC Berkeley, \citeentry{DEC}'s Western Research
Laboratories, Ohio State University, and the University of Texas. Compare
\citeentry{rib site}, \citeentry{leaf site}.

[1996 update: This term is seldom heard any more. The UUCP network would that
gave it meaning has nearly disappeared; everyone is on the Internet now and
network traffic is distributed in very different patterns. Today one might see
references to a `backbone router' instead --ESR]
