\mainentry{bondage-and-discipline language} n.

A language (such as \citeentry{Pascal}, \citeentry{Ada}, APL, or Prolog) that,
though ostensibly general-purpose, is designed so as to enforce an author's
theory of `right programming' even though said theory is demonstrably inadequate
for systems hacking or even vanilla general-purpose programming. Often
abbreviated `B\&D'; thus, one may speak of things ``having the B\&D nature''.
See \citeentry{Pascal}; oppose \citeentry{languages of choice}.
