\mainentry{book titles}

There is a tradition in hackerdom of informally tagging important textbooks and
standards documents with the dominant color of their covers or with some other
conspicuous feature of the cover. Many of these are described in this lexicon
under their own entries. See \citeentry{Aluminum Book}, \citeentry{Blue Book},
\citeentry{Camel Book}, \citeentry{Cinderella Book}, \citeentry{Devil Book},
\citeentry{Dragon Book}, \citeentry{Green Book}, \citeentry{Orange Book},
\citeentry{Purple Book}, \citeentry{Red Book}, \citeentry{Silver Book},
\citeentry{White Book}, \citeentry{Wizard Book}, \citeentry{Yellow Book},
\citeentry{bible}; see also \citeentry{rainbow series}. Since about 1983 this
tradition has gotten a boost from the popular O'Reilly and Associates line of
technical books, which usually feature some kind of exotic animal on the cover.
