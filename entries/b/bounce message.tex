\mainentry{bounce message} n.

[common] Notification message returned to sender by a site unable to relay
\citeentry{email} to the intended \citeentry{Internet address} recipient or the
next link in a \citeentry{bang path} (see \citesense{bounce}{1}). Reasons might
include a nonexistent or misspelled username or a \citeentry{down} relay site.
Bounce messages can themselves fail, with occasionally ugly results; see
\citeentry{sorcerer's apprentice mode} and \citeentry{software laser}. The terms
`bounce mail' and `barfmail' are also common.
