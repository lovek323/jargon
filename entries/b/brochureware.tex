\mainentry{brochureware} n.

Planned but non-existent product like \citeentry{vaporware}, but with the added
implication that marketing is actively selling and promoting it (they've printed
brochures). Brochureware is often deployed as a strategic weapon; the idea is to

be more expensive than and inferior to the alternatives that had been available
for years.
