\mainentry{bug-for-bug compatible} adj.\opt{changes}{\footnote{Was listed as a
noun, but this makes no sense. Firstly, if it is ``same as bug-compatible'', it
is likely to be an adjective. Secondly, one would never say ``Oh, look at this
bug-for-bug compatible``, one would say ``Oh, look at this product, it is
bug-for-bug compatible''.}}

Same as \citeentry{bug-compatible}, with the additional implication that much
tedious effort went into ensuring that each (known) bug was replicated.
