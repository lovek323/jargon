\mainentry{black art} n.

[common] A collection of arcane, unpublished, and (by implication) mostly ad-hoc
techniques developed for a particular application or systems area (compare
\citeentry{black magic}). VLSI design and compiler code optimization were (in
their beginnings) considered classic examples of black art; as theory developed
they became \citeentry{deep magic}, and once standard textbooks had been
written, became merely \citeentry{heavy wizardry}. The huge proliferation of
formal and informal channels for spreading around new computer-related
technologies during the last twenty years has made both the term `black art' and
what it describes far less common than formerly. See also \citeentry{voodoo
programming}.
