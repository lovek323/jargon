\mainentry{brute force and ignorance} n.

A popular design technique at many software houses -- \citeentry{brute force}
coding unrelieved by any knowledge of how problems have been previously solved
in elegant ways. Dogmatic adherence to design methodologies tends to encourage
this sort of thing. Characteristic of early \citeentry{larval stage}
programming; unfortunately, many never outgrow it. Often abbreviated BFI: ``Gak,
they used a \citeentry{bubble sort}! That's strictly from BFI.'' Compare
\citeentry{bogosity}.
