\mainentry{busy-wait} vi.

Used of human behavior, conveys that the subject is busy waiting for someone or
something, intends to move instantly as soon as it shows up, and thus cannot do
anything else at the moment. ``Can't talk now, I'm busy-waiting till Bill gets
off the phone.''

Technically, `busy-wait' means to wait on an event by \citeentry{spin}ning
through a tight or time-delay loop that polls for the event on each pass, as
opposed to setting up an interrupt handler and continuing execution on another
part of the task. This is a wasteful technique, best avoided on time-sharing
systems where a busy-waiting program may \citeentry{hog} the processor.
