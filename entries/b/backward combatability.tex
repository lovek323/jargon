\mainentry{backward combatability} /bak'w*rd k*m-bat'*-bil'*-tee/ n.

[CMU, Tektronix: from `backward compatability'] A property of hardware or
software revisions in which previous protocols, formats, layouts, etc. are
irrevocably discarded in favor of `new and improved' protocols, formats, and
layouts, leaving the previous ones not merely deprecated but actively defeated.
(Too often, the old and new versions cannot definitively be distinguished, such
that lingering instances of the previous ones yield crashes or other
infelicitious effects, as opposed to a simple ``version mismatch'' message.) A
backwards compatible change, on the other hand, allows old versions to coexist
without crashes or error messages, but too many major changes incorporating
elaborate backwards compatibility processing can lead to extreme
\citeentry{software bloat}. See also \citeentry{flag day}.
