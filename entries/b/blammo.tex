\mainentry{blammo} n.

[Oxford Brookes University and alumni, UK] To forcibly remove someone from any
interactive system, especially the talker systems. The operators, who may remain
hidden, may `blammo' a user who is misbehaving. Very similar to MIT
\citeentry{gun}; in fact, the `blammo-gun' is a notional device used to `blammo'
someone. While in actual fact the only incarnation of the blammo-gun set to
`main' will stop someone coming back for a while.
