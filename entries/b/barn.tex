\mainentry{barn} n.

[uncommon; prob. from the nuclear military] An unexpectedly large quantity of
something: a unit of measurement. ``Why is /var/adm taking up so much space?''
``The logs have grown to several barns.'' The source of this is clear: when
physicists were first studying nuclear interactions, the protability was thought
to be proportional to the cross-sectional area of the nucleus (this probability
is still called the cross-section).. Upon experimenting, they discovered the
interactions were far more probable than expected; the nuclei were `as big as a
barn'. The units for cross-sections were christened Barns, ($10^{-24}\mbox{
cm}^2$) and the book containing cross-sections has a picture of a barn on the
cover.
