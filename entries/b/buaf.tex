\mainentry{BUAF} // n.

[abbreviation, from alt.fan.warlord] Big Ugly ASCII Font -- a special form of
\citeentry{ASCII art}. Various programs exist for rendering text strings into
block, bloob, and pseudo-script fonts in cells between four and six character
cells on a side; this is smaller than the letters generated by older
\citesense{banner}{2} programs. These are sometimes used to render one's name in
a \citeentry{sig block}, and are critically referred to as `BUAF's. See
\citeentry{warlording}.
