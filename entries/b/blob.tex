\mainentry{BLOB}

\begin{inparaenum}
\item n. [acronym: Binary Large Object] Used by database people to refer to any
    random large block of bits that needs to be stored in a database, such as a
    picture or sound file. The essential point about a BLOB is that it's an
    object that cannot be interpreted within the database itself.
\item v. To \citeentry{mailbomb} someone by sending a BLOB to him/her; esp. used
    as a mild thread. ``If that program crashes again, I'm going to BLOB the
    core dump to you.''
