\mainentry{boustrophedon} n.

[from a Greek word for turning like an ox while plowing] An ancient method of
writing using alternate left-to-right and right-to-left lines. This term is
actually philologists' techspeak and typesetter's jargon. Erudite hackers use it
for an optimization performed by some computer typesetting software and
moving-head printers. The adverbial form `boustrophedonically' is also found
(hackers purely love constructions like this).
