\mainentry{banana problem} n.

[from the story of the little girl who sayd ``I know how to spell `banana', but
I don't know when to stop'']. Not knowing where or when to bring a production to
a close (compare \citeentry{fencepost error}). One may say `there is a banana
problem' of an algorithm with poorly defined or incorrect termination
conditions, or in discussing the evolution of a design that may be succumbing to
featuritis (see also \citeentry{creeping elegance}, \citeentry{creeping
featuritis}). See item 176 under \citeentry{HAKMEM}, which describes a banana
problem in a \citeentry{Dissociated Press} implementation. Also, see one
\citeentry{one-banana problem} for a superficially similar but unrelated usage.
