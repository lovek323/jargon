\mainentry{bigot}
[common] A person who is religiously attached to a particular computer,
language, operating system, editor, or other tool (see \citeentry{religious
issues}). Usually found with a specifier; thus, `cray bigot', `ITS bigot', `APL
bigot', `VMS bigot', `Berkeley bigot'. Real bigots can be distinguished from
mere partisans or zealots by the fact that they refuse to learn alternatives
even when the march of time and/or technology is threatening to obsolete the
favored tool. It is truly said ``You can tell a bigot, but you can't tell him
much.'' Compare \citeentry{weenie}, \citeentry{Amiga Persecution Complex}.
