\mainentry{boat anchor} n.

[common; from ham radio]
\begin{inparaenum}
\item Like \citeentry{doorstop} but more severe; implies that the offending
    hardware is irreversibly dead or useless. ``That was a working motherboard
    once. One lightning strike later, instant boat anchor!''
\item A person who just takes up space.
\item Obsolete but still working hardware, especially when used of an old
    S100-bus hobbyist system; originally a term of annoyance, but became more
    and more affectionate as the hardware became more and more obsolete.
\end{inparaenum}
