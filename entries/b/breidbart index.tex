\mainentry{Breidbart Index} /bri:d'bart ind*ks/

A measurement of the severity of spam invented by long-time hacker Seth
Breidbart, used for programming cancelbots. The Breidbart Index takes into
account the fact that excessive multi-posting \citeentry{EMP} is worse than
excessive cross-posting \citeentry{ECP}. The Breidbart Index is computed as
follows: For each article in a spam, take the square-root of the number of
newsgroups to which the article is posted. The Breidbart Index is the sum of the
square roots of all the posts in the spam. For example, one article posted to
nine newsgroups and again to sixteen would have a $BI=\sqrt{9}+\sqrt{16}=7$. It
is generally agreed that a spam is cancelable if the Breidbart Index exceeds 20.

The Breidbart Index accumulates over a 45-day window. Ten articles yesterday and
ten articles today and ten articles tomorrow add up to a 30-article spam. Spam
fighters will often reset the count if you can convince them that the spam was
accidental and/or you have seen the error of your ways and won't repeat it.
Breidbart Index can accumulate over multiple authors. For example, the ``Make
Money Fast'' pyramid scheme exceeded a BI of 20 a long time ago, and is now
considered ``cancel on sight''.
