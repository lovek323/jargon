\mainentry{barney} n.

In Commonwealth hackish, `barney's is to \citesense{fred}{1} as \citeentry{bar}
is to \citeentry{foo}. That is, people who commonly use `fred' as their first
metasyntactic variable will often use `barney' second. The reference is, of
course, to Fred Flinstone and Barney Rubble in the Flintstones cartoons.
