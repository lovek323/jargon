\mainentry{banner} n.

\begin{inparaenum}
    \item The title page added to printouts by most print spoolers (see
        \citeentry{spool}). Typically includes user or account ID information in
        very large character-graphics capitals. Also called a `burst page',
        because it indicates where to burst (tear apart) fanfold paper to
        separate one user's printout from the next.
    \item A similar printout generated (typically on multiple pages of fan-fold
        paper) from user-specified text, e.g., by a program such as Unix's
        banner(\{1,6\}).
    \item On interactive software, a first screen containing a logo and/or
        author credits and/or a copyright notice. This is probably now the
        commonest sense.
