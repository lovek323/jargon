\mainentry{bomb}

\begin{inparaenum}
\item v. General synonym for \citesense{crash}{1} except that it is not used
    as a noun; esp. used of software or OS failures. ``Don't rum Empire with
    less than 32K stack, it'll bomb.''
\item n.,v. Atari ST and Macintosh equivalents of a Unix `panic' or Amiga
    \citesense{guru}{2} in which icons of little black-powder bombs or mushroom
    clouds are displayed, indicating that the system has died. On the Mac, this
    may be accompanied by a decimal (or occasionally hexadecimal) number
    indicating what went wrong, similar to the Amiga \citeentry{guru meditation}
    number. \citeentry{MS-DOS} machines tend to get \citeentry{locked up} in
    this situation.
