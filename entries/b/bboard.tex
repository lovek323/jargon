\mainentry{bboard} /bee'bord/ n.

[contraction of `bulletin board']
\begin{inparaenum}
    \item Any electronic bulletin board; esp. used of \citeentry{BBS} systems
        running on personal micros, less frequently of a Usenet
        \citeentry{newsgroup} (in fact, use of this term for a newsgroup
        generally marks one either as a \citeentry{newbie} fresh in from the BBS
        world or as a real old-timer predating Usenet).
    \item At CMU and other colleges with similar facilities, refers to
        campus-wide electronic bulletin boards.
    \item The term `physical bboard' is sometimes used to refer to an
        old-fashioned, non-electronic cork-and-thumbtack memo board. At CMU, it
        refers to a particular one outside the CS Lounge.
\end{inparaenum}

In either of senses 1 or 2, the term is suually prefixed by the name of the
intended board (`the Moonlight Casino bboard'); however, if the context is
clear, the better-read bboards may be referred to by name alone, as in (at CMU)
``Don't post for-sale ads on general''.
