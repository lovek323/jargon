\mainentry{Bad and Wrong} adj.

[Durham, UK] Said of something that is both badly designed and wrongly executed.
This common term is the prototype of, and is used in contrast with, three less
common terms -- Bad and Right (a kludge, something ugly but functional); Good
and Wrong (an overblown GUI or other attractive nuisance); and (rare praise)
Good and Right. These terms entered common use at Durham c.1994 and may have
been imported from elsewhere. There are standard abbreviations: they start with
B\&R, a typo for ``Bad and Wrong''. Consequently, B\&W is actually ``Bad and
Right'', G\&R = ``Good and Wrong'', and G\&W = ``Good and Right'. Compare
\citeentry{evil and rude}, \citeentry{Good Thing}, \citeentry{Bad Thing}.
