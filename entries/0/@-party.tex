\mainentry{@-party} /at'par`tee/ n.

[from the @-sign in an Internet address] (alt. `@-sign party' /at'si:n
par`tee/) A semi-closed party thrown for hackers at a science-fiction
convention (esp. the annual World Science Fiction Convention or
``Worldcon''); one must have a \citeentry{network address} to get in, or
at least be in company with someone who does. One of the most reliable
opportunities for hackers to meet face to face with people who might
otherwise be represented by mere phosphor dots on their screens. Compare
\citeentry{boink}.

The first recorded @-party was held at the Westercon (a California SF
convention) over the July 4th weekend in 1980. It is not clear exactly
when the canonical @-party venue shifted to the Worldcon but it had
certainly become established by Constellation in 1983. Sadly, the
@-party tradition has been in decline since about 1996, mainly because
having an @-address no longer functions as an effective lodge pin.
