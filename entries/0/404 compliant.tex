\mainentry{404 compliant} adj.

The status of a website which has been completely removed, usually by
the administrators of the hosting site as a result of net abuse by the
website operators. The term is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the
standard ``301 compliant'' Murkowski Bill disclaimer used by spammers.
Soo also: \citeentry{spam}, \citeentry{spamvertize}.
