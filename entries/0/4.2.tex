\mainentry{annoyware} n.

A type of \citeentry{shareware} that frequently disrupts normal program
operation to display requests for payment to the author in return for
the ability to disable the request messages. (Also called `nagware') The
requests generally require user action to acknowledge the message before
normal operation is resumed and are often tied to the most frequently
used features of the software. See also \citeentry{careware},
\citeentry{charityware}, \citeentry{crippleware}, \citeentry{freeware},
\citeentry{FRS}, \citeentry{guiltware}, \citeentry{postcardware}, and
