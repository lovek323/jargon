\mainentry{2} infix.

In translation software written by hackers, infix 2 often represents the
syllable `to'\opt{changes}{\footnote{There were no quotes in the
original. I felt that the addition of quotes made the sentence more
readable.}} with the connotation `translate to': as in dvi2ps (DVI to
PostScript), int2string (integer to string), and texi2roff (Texinfo to
\[nt\]roff). Several versions of a joke have floated around the internet
in which some idiot programmer fixes the Y2K bug by changing all the Y's
in something to K's, as in Januark, Februark, etc.
