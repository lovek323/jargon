``Early in 1976, a report by the Federal Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (_Electronic Mail_, Bonn, 1976) described electronic mail
systems with concepts found in both Generations II and III. It concluded that electronic mail could be realized by means of the technology
available today, but that terminals need to be developed further. The report noted that electronic mail will be used by private
householders only if it offers lower charges or more convenience. Speed is not a major determinant since 95 percent of all letters are now
delivered the following day.'' -- _Electronic message systems for the U.S. Postal Service: a report_, National Academies, 1976, p. 44.

``Cable television (CATV) is unique in that it is the only wire, besides telephone, with potential access to 80 million customers. Many new services have been proposed to utilize this access-from meter reading to transmission of an entire book in seconds. The author postulates that electronic mail is the market CATV should pursue and describes the market potential, a system design in some detail, and an estimate of the costs involved. An intriguing result of this analysis is the possibility of sending mail electronically for only 10 cents a letter.'' -- Gross, W. B., ``Distribution of electronic mail over the broad-band party-line communications network'' in volum 58, issue 7 of _Proceedings of the IEEE_, published in July 1970
